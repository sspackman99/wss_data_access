# Soil Data

This repository documents how to access the USDA's Web Soil Survey with Python.


## The code

**soildb.r** is the r function that accesses the Web Soil Survey API

**web_soil_survey.py** is the python function I wrote loosely based on the function in **soildb.r**

**web_soil_survey_sample.ipynb** is a jupyter notebook giving a sample query that could be passed into **web_soil_survey.py**


## The story

Check out my post on my blog Data Science Magic if you want to learn more about my inspiration for the project and see what I did!
