# Soil Data

This repository documents how to access the USDA's [Web Soil Survey](https://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/App/HomePage.htm) with Python.


## The code

**soildb.r** is the r function that accesses the Web Soil Survey API

**web_soil_survey.py** is the python function I wrote loosely based on the function in **soildb.r**

**web_soil_survey_sample.ipynb** is a jupyter notebook giving a sample query that could be passed into **web_soil_survey.py**

[Here is a link](https://sdmdataaccess.nrcs.usda.gov/) to the help page that will direct you to answers to your WSS questions
